## Learning Points
### Setting JS Variables
- For this project it was important to keep track of numerous variables. These variables are used to hold information for our program. We are able to set values such as strings and arrays, which were used to access the information needed to generate our password.

### Working Prompt/Confirm/Alert
- By using the built in Window Objects, we are able to give our user choices and the program able to take in information that it can then use as part of it's parameters. Through the prompt the user is asked what the length used will be for the password. By using the Confirm window object, we are able to then refine the choices and set parameters regarding the characters that are able to be used for the Password.
